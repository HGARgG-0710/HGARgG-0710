# Howdy! I'm Igor.  

Occasionally write stuff for fun in: web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL), C/C++ (compilers: gcc, g++ correpondently), Java, Python, TeX, Lua, little bit of Ruby. Familiar with git and npm.  
Been doing (non-professionaly, as a hobby) software development for about 5 years. 

Very comfortable with using Vim in combination with VSCode [(through the VSCodeVim plugin)](https://github.com/VsCodeVim/Vim). 

Made a perculiar JS mathematics library that periodically has some bugs, spontaneous Python cmd calculator (I like cmd calculators) 
and an overloads.js library (something like an extension of JavaScript, simple typescript alternative). 
Love microcontroller stuff, alike Arduino. 

Favourite programming languages: C, C++, JavaScript (in that order, Java is the fourth). 

Favorite markdown language: TeX. 

Has written most code in JavaScript.
