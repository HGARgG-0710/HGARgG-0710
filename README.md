# Howdy!

Some random guy. 

Occasionally write stuff for fun in: web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL), C/C++ (compilers: gcc, g++ correpondently), Java, Python, TeX, Ruby, little bit of Lua. Familiar with git and npm.  
Been doing (non-professionaly, as a hobby) software development for about 5 years. 

Made a perculiar JS mathematics library that periodically has some bugs 
and a spontaneous Python cmd calculator (I like cmd calculators). 
Love microcontroller stuff, alike Arduino. 

Favourite programming languages: C, C++, JavaScript (in that order, Java is the fourth). 

Favorite markdown language: TeX. 

Has written most code in JavaScript.
